# Feature Parity Standard (AI Agents)

`FEATURE_PARITY.md` must be updated in the same branch when implementation status changes.

## Required

- If feature behavior/status changed, update corresponding parity row(s).
- Keep status markers and notes consistent (`❌`, `🚧`, `✅`).
- Do not open/prepare a PR with behavior changes while parity tracking is stale.

## Scope

This applies to feature additions, removals, substantial behavior changes, and status transitions.
